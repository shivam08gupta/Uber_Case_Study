# Uber_Case_Study


# Business Objectives
The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) 
and recommend ways to improve the situation. As a result of your analysis, you should be able to present to the 
client the root cause(s) and possible hypotheses of the problem(s) and recommend ways to improve them.


# There are six attributes associated with each request made by a customer:

Request id: A unique identifier of the request
Time of request: The date and time at which the customer made the trip request
Drop-off time: The drop-off date and time, in case the trip was completed 
Pick-up point: The point from which the request was made
Driver id: The unique identification number of the driver
Status of the request: The final status of the trip, that can be either completed, cancelled by the driver or no cars available
Note: For this assignment, only the trips to and from the airport are being considered.

 

# Data Cleaning and Preparation - Hints

Identify the data quality issues and clean the data so that you can use it for analysis.
Ensure that the dates and time are in the proper format. Derive new variables which will be useful for analysis.
 

# Results Expected
Visually identify the most pressing problems for Uber. 
Hint: Create plots to visualise the frequency of requests that get cancelled or show 'no cars available'; identify the most problematic types of requests (city to airport / airport to city etc.) and the time slots (early mornings, late evenings etc.) using plots
Find out the gap between supply and demand and show the same using plots.
Find the time slots when the highest gap exists
Find the types of requests (city-airport or airport-city) for which the gap is the most severe in the identified time slots
What do you think is the reason for this issue for the supply-demand gap? Write the answer in less than 100 words. You may accompany the write-up with plot(s).
 Recommend some ways to resolve the supply-demand gap.
